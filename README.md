# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine if Amazon video reviews are legitimate and fair - or, if they reflect bias from paid reviews. The raw data from the Digital Video Game Reviews dataset was transformed using the ETL. Running PySpark then assess the level of bias, if any.

##Results

  - There do no appear to be any paid reviews based on the analysis

It can be concluded that the reviews are therefore a fair reflection of consumer feeling about the video games.
